## Assignment 1

As you might already know, a Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of the bridge circuit.
    In the balanced state, no current passses through the bridged leg, and hence theoretically, the bridged LED should not glow. We can demonstrate this practically by connecting 5 LEDs and 5 resistors in the following way.

### Circuit connections

### Explanation

Battery connections:

- The positive terminal of LED 1 and positive terminal of LED 2 are connected to each other with a Red wire, which is then connected to the positive terminal of the 9V battery.
- The negative terminal of LED 3 and negative terminal of LED 4 are connected to each other with a Black wire, which is then connected to the negative terminal of the 9V battery.

Resistor connections:

- The negative terminal of LED 1 and LED 2 are connected to resistors.
- Similarly, the positive terminal of LED 3 and LED 4 are connected to resistors.

Bridged LED connections:

- One end of the bridged LED (positive terminal in this case) is placed at a junction, which is connected to LED 1 and LED 3 through resistors.
- The other end of the bridged LED (negative terminal in this case) is connected to a resistor, which placed at a junction and is connected to LED 2 and LED 4 through resistors.

On completion of the circuit, we see that LED 1, LED 2, LED 3, LED 4 glow while LED 5 doesn't.
