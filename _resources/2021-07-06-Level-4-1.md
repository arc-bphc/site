## Pull-Up Resistors

A pull-up resistor is a simple resistor used to make sure that the voltage is well-defined even when the switch is open. It is used to ensure that a wire is **pulled up** to a high logical level in the absence of an input signal.

### pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP)

The Arduino comes equipped with internal resistors which can be operated in the Pull-Up mode.

As you would have noticed in the pinMode() documentation [(Link)](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/pinmode/), The Digital GPIO pins can operate in the INPUT_PULLUP which enables the internal resistors on that pin and let's the pin be used in Pull-Up mode.

## Switch Debouncing

### Bouncing?

A Push button comprises of two metal contacts that touch upon pressing action on the button. Upon touching the metal contacts bounce upon each other making the switch on and off for a time after impact from pressing action by user.

Thus, if the sensing element is sensitive enough, it registers multiple button press from a single action. This can introduce errors in the system you are using and can hinder a lot of processes.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Level 4/bouncing.png" alt="Bouncing" width=500px height=auto>

To overcome these errors we establish "Debouncing" Techniques, This can be achieved both via software or hardware tweaks.

An very simple software debounce is to employ a delay before registering the button's state thus avoiding the Bouncing state of the button.

## millis()

This function returns the number of milliseconds passed since the Arduino board began running the current program.

**Syntax**: `time_variable = millis()`

## Analog Input

The Arduino UNO has 6 pins (A0 to A5) that can read analog input voltages received between 0 and the Operating voltage (Generally 5V).

These Analog Pins map the input voltages to a resolved value between 0 and 1023, Using a 10 bit ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)

**Links to Follow :** [Analog Input?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmc-BPtkdAU&feature=youtu.be)



## analogRead()

This in-built arduino function reads a value from a GPIO analog pin and resolves it to a value between 0 and 1023 which can be stored as an integer type variable.

**Syntax** : `analogRead(pin)`

```c++
int analogPin = 42;
int val; //to store the analog read

void setup(){

pinMode(analogPin, INPUT);
}

void loop(){

val = analogRead(analogPin);
}
```

**Can you use the analog pins(A0- A5) for Digtal Functions?**

Find out for yourself!

## analogWrite()

The arduino has 6 digital GPIO pins which can perform PWM to produce a varying duty cycle which can be controlled by passing a value between 0 and 255.

Pins **3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11** on the Arduino UNO are equipped with the PWM logic, They can be used for both digitalWrite() and analogWrite().

**Syntax** : `analogWrite(Pin_number, value)`

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Level 4/pwm.png" alt="PWM" width=500px height=auto>

Notice how the pins have a ~ symbol on them to help differentiate.

## Dim an LED

```c++
int brightness = 0;

void setup()
{
	pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
	// Increase brightness from 0 to 255
	for  (brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness += 5)  {
		analogWrite(9,  brightness);
		delay(30);
     }
	//Decrease brightness from 255 to 0
	for  (brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness -= 5)  {
		analogWrite(9,  brightness);
		delay(30);
     }
}
```

## Pulse Width Modulation

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique for creating analog results with digital means. The Arduino generates a square wave, a signal switched on and off. This on- off pattern can simulate voltages in between the full Vcc (5V) and off (0V) by changing the **"duty cycle"** of the Square wave.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Level 4/PWM_2.png" alt="PWM_2" width=800px height=auto>

## Duty Cycle

When the signal is high, we call this **"on time"**. The Duty cycle specifically describes the percentage of time a digital signal is **On** (5V) over an interval or period of time.

$$
duty\ cycle = {t_{on} \above{2pt} t_{on}+t_{off}}\newline
$$

$$

\begin{gather}

t_{on} = ON\ time\newline

t_{off} = OFF\ time\newline

t_{on} + t_{off} = Time\ period\newline

\end{gather}

$$

$$
V_{average} = 5V \times Duty\ Cycle
$$

## Analog Sensors

### Potentiometer

A 3-terminal instrument which measures and gives out a fraction of voltage applied across its two ends, depending upon the variation of the position of sliding contact over the uniform resistance (placed in a semi-circular manner, acting as a voltage divider).

- [Simulating a Potentiometer in TinkerCAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb_0QxeInDs)



### LDR

A Light Dependent Resistor (a.k.a photoresistor or LDR) is a device whose resistivity varies with the incident electromagnetic radiation. Hence, they are light-sensitive devices. Also called photoconductors / photoconductive cells or simply photocells.

When the light of enough energy falls on it, the number of electrons available for the conduction increases proportional to the intensity of light.

## RGB LED

The RGB LED can emit different colors by mixing the 3 basic colors red, green and blue. So it actually consists of 3 separate LEDs red, green and blue packed in a single case. That’s why it has 4 leads, one lead for each of the 3 colors and one common cathode or anode depending on the RGB LED type.

Make a circuit that has 1 RGB LED, 3 LDR sensors (or Potentiometers), and a button. When a **push button is pressed**, the LED should cycle between red, blue, and green colors. There should be one LDR/Potentiometer for each color to **control its brightness** when it is active.

## Assignment 2

Generate a PWM wave of any desired **% Duty Cycle** from a **Non-PWM supporting pin** (Pins other than 3,5,6,9,10,11) and demonstrate the square wave on an **oscilloscope**. Pick a convenient Frequency for your square wave.

## Assignment 3

Task :- Make a 4 wheeled bot like shown in the figure.

This week you have to use your creativity for the part designing , but emphasis will be on the assembly and the type of mates being used.
Guidelines for Parts :-
(i) The dimensions of these parts are available online and you can use the specified dimensions. But no marks will be given for this. It is just to make your task simpler.

Guidelines for Assembly :-
(i) Make sure mates are realistic. Eg: A wheel mounted onto the bot should be capable of rotation.
(ii) Make sure dimensions are appropriate. Eg: The wheel should have proper dimensions to fit onto the shaft it’s being mounted on. Other dimensions like length of chassis or diameter of wheel are left to your discretion.

Guidelines for Motion Study :-
(i) Give the same rpm to all motors and show the wheels spinning.
(ii) People using Fusion show an animation of the wheels spinning.

Guidelines for submission :-
(i) Use .sldasm and .sldprt file format for the files and include a video recording of the animation not longer than 10 sec.
(ii) Use native Fusion 360 format .f3d format and include a video recording of the animation not longer than 10 sec. (NO NEED to convert into .iges/.igs formats)
