# Day 1 Session 2

Hey! Welcome to the first CAD session of our workshop.



In this section, you will be learning about
- CAD Softwares and their features
- Onshape Basics
- Working with 2D sketches in Onshape


# What is Computer Aided Design (CAD) ?

Computer Aided design is a broad field that involves using various computer softwares like Solidworks, Fusion 360, AutoCAD etc. to make 2D sketches and 3D models of real world products that you would like to manufacture. 

For example, let us assume that you want to manufacture a chassis for a simple 4 wheeled robot, powered by 4 motors, i.e 1 motor for each wheel. You would first start by choosing a shape you want for the chassis, this could be done by drawing inspirations from other CAD models that have been built for similar purposes or you could create freehand sketches (concept drawings), which are widely used to explore initial design ideas and options available. Once you have a rough idea about how you want the part to look like, you can now start by deciding its important characteristics, i.e material, weight, dimensions etc.. After this you would move on to a CAD software where you would start creating the chassis according to its characteristics.

## Features of  CAD
CAD softwares like Fusion 360 and Solidworks, come with a lot of features that designers often use to improve or validate their designs. These features help in analysing various aspects of a design, this helps in answering important questions like, if the part designed is suitable for a particular task? Will it be able to withstand the loads given to it during real life application? How much can we expect the part to deform during operation?
#### 2D Sketches
There are various tools available in every CAD software to make 2D sketches, basic tools include: line, circle, polygon, arc, mirror, ellipse, fillet all these and more shall be explained in detail in future sessions related to CAD. In our case, we would first want to create the top rectangular surface of the chassis which we would later extrude. This top surface would be sketched after first choosing a sketching plane and using a line or a polygon command to construct a rectangle according to the chosen dimensions.
#### 3D tools
3D tools are usually used after making the sketch, these tools comprise of features like extrude, revolve, cut, sweep, fillet, loft, more of which shall be explained in greater detail in future sessions on CAD. After making 2D sketches of surfaces of the chassis, we would now extrude these sketches, which basically means giving them a certain depth or thickness. After we are done with the extrusions, we can see that our 3D model looks almost complete, however, there is a lot more to the construction phase than you might expect. For further enhancement of the design you would also like to add certain finishing touches like fillets. Fillets are used to make curved edges and they are important as curved edges are much more efficient in distributing stress throughout the body, thereby, increasing its durability and lowering the risk of failure of the body against high loads. In some cases, fillet also makes the part more aerodynamic and easy to manufacture.

#### Static structural simulations: 
Most CAD softwares come with these analysis features, for the example stated earlier, you would probably perform static structural simulations on the chassis. This involves applying loads on various areas of the chassis and applying certain boundary conditions (areas that would act as fixed supports during the load application). The software would then highlight different areas of the model with different colours to indicate regions that would experience more stress, deformation or strain relative to others. After carefully analysing these regions we could refine our design to make it more efficient, by removing excess material, and durable, by adding materials or support to areas that have high chances of failing during application.  

#### Topology optimisation:
Topology optimisation involves optimising the shape of a part based on the loads and boundary conditions that it will face during its application. As stated earlier, after doing a thorough analysis of stresses and strains endured on various regions of the chassis, you might realise that certain areas of the chassis experience almost zero stress and do not contribute much in giving support to regions that are facing high stress. This means that you could remove material from these regions as it is unnecessary. This could be done automatically, i.e the software could judge such areas and reduce material from it or manually. However, we must also keep in mind the manufacturability of the product, a lot of the times the geometry obtained after topology optimisation is almost impossible or extremely hard to manufacture.

##### There are various other features, that haven't been touched upon, for e.g CFD (deals with fluid flows around an object), modal analysis (helps vibrational analysis) that are used at an advanced level to acheive a better understanding of various parts of a design. Sometimes softwares like ANSYS that are specifically built for carrying out these simulations are used for getting more accurate results than a CAD software's inbuilt features.

## Different CAD softwares
There are a variety of softwares that you could use, few of those are Solidworks, Fusion 360, AutoCAD, Creo, Onshape (online website). Since Fusion and Solidworks are some of the most popular CAD softwares used we would be looking at their differences in detail.

Solidworks is an assembly driven software which means that you can create parts of a complex model individually, in different files, and assemble these in a separate file. Unlike Solidworks, Fusion allows us to create multiple components in the same file making it easier for users to reference other components and design accordingly. Consequently, Fusion is ideal for making parts that require a lesser amount of components.

As described earlier, to validate designs, several simulations are performed and both softwares come inbuilt with these simulation features. Fusion is good for doing a basic analysis and is easy to use, its limitation being its inability to give accurate results. Solidworks is used for acheiving more accurate results, and can be used by people who have prior experience in FEA.

There are various other features that differ in both of these softwares, in conclusion, Fusion is an easy-to-use, beginner friendly software, whereas, Solidworks is used by more experienced CAD engineers.




#  Onshape BASICS

**Onshape** is a cloud-based computer-aided design (CAD) software. Using web-based servers, software users can collaborate on a single model, editing and interacting at the same time.

Onshape will be the CAD software used for this workshop.

As a part of our Day 0 session, you would have signed up for an Onshape account





## 2D Drawings

All ONSHAPE models that have to be created typically begin with a **2D sketch**. This is where we create basic shapes and specify dimensions. These sketches are then going to be used to create 3D CAD models.

## Creating a document:

1. First, we create a new document using the Create button on the top left

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session2/Screenshot_20210721_152146.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>

2. When we open a new workspace, we start in the 3D environment. The 3D environment view may be rotated by using right click + drag.
3. Use to cube on the top right to orient the sketch as required
4. Press and hold the mouse wheel to pan the workspace
5. Scroll wheel zooms in the direction of the cursor



    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session2/Screenshot_20210721_184545.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>








For a more detailed explanation on how sketch works and how to use various tools that are available it is **recommended** to go through the following videos:
- [BASIC 2D drawing](https://youtu.be/2l8Do2Uk_JQ)
- [BASIC sketch tools](https://youtu.be/3kwgWZ6LQf8)


# Creating a new sketch

1. On the Features panel, we can select a plane to create our sketch on.
2. Right-click on the selected plane and then choose 'New sketch'

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session2/Screenshot_20210721_154803.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>


3. After creating a sketch, we can double click on from the Features panel it to view it

4. You will notice that the toolbar also has a new set of tools
 
5. A dialog box also appears to indicate that you are working on the sketch


    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session2/dialog.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>

6. Right clicking on the workspace gives us the option to  view normal to the sketch plane


**NOTE:** If you accidentally click the red x and cancel the sketch, you have ten seconds to click Restore in the blue message at the top of the window to restore the sketch.






## Drawing Tools

Here are some important drawing tools used in Onshape:

1. Point Tool: 

    - Allows the user to create points on a plane
    - Snaps to nearby major point if available

2. Dimension Tool:

    - Onshape makes use of a smart dimension tool.
    - Can set dimensions between two selected elements
    - Can an also input a distance then points will follow that constraint
    - Based on cursor placement, one can dimension diagonally, horizontally or vertically
    - Can also dimension angles by clicking on two lines

3. Line Tool: 

    - Click and release to create a line.
    - Snaps to nearest major point if available.
    - Can be dimensioned when it is made

**TIP:** Do not press enter after you click to set the line, as this helps you specify the exact dimensions of the object without having to edit the dimensions later. Saves time :)

4. Relation Tool

    - The relation tool consists of subtools contained in a dropdown menu.
    - These tools are used to define relations between two curves in a sketch plane.

Some examples:

1. Tangent tool
2. Equal tool
3. Concentric tool



## Sketch Constraints

Sketch constraints are a fantastic way to ensure accuracy in your sketching. Through constraints you can ensure something is on the midpoint, is perfectly concentric, won’t move from a line and more. Constraints are perfect for designing functional CAD models.

## Important colours in sketches and what they indicate:

### Blue:
Under defined

### Black: 
Fully defined 

### Red:
- Sketches can become over-constrained; this is where a constraint you want to apply would conflict with the rest of the constraints/dimensions on the sketch object.
- Here you will encounter Over defined (Clash) / Sketch could not be solved.



## Eliminating Overdefined Parts of the Sketch & Removing Clashes

- Check for overdefined (indicated in red)
- Hit the 'Esc' key to exit the current tool in use
- Select and delete the overdefined dimension


**Tips:** 

- Don't be afraid to make mistakes, you can always hit Ctrl + Z to undo a step.
- Hit the 'Esc' key to exit a selected tool.
- Hovering over a point also shows the constraints it is under.




> Onshape is a 'Parametric Software'. This means we can always go back and change a parameter later on. This allows for tweaks to be made quickly and easily when dimensions are not finalised.



## Snap:

Snap is a feature in CAD software that helps speed up workflow. It assumes that you want to work with pre-existing points while adding new elements, and also suggests constraints based on the sketch.

For example : 
While drawing a line, if  you hover your cursor over a horizontal line, it creates a horizontal constraint, shown below

### Note: 
As you may have noticed Onshape gives us the freedom to choose our own workflow. We can choose to:

1. Dimension each entity of the sketch as you go

      OR
2. create the sketch elements constrain them later using the tools in the toolbar




# Demonstration of 2D Sketches

In the following section, we will go over the process and general guidelines to be followed while creating a sketch in Onshape. This will be illustrated with the help of an example.


You will be introduced to the following concepts:

- Construction Lines: These are entities that you will be using as reference for your sketch, and will be indicated using dotted lines
- Arc tool
- Slot tool
- Tangent tool
- Mirror Tool
- Trim Tool
