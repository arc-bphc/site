# Introduction
ARC is proud to present a one of a kind 3-day online **Introduction To Robotics Workshop** with actual **hands-on kits** and **zero prerequisites**, the participants will be exposed to the fundamentals of programming, electronics and design which makeup the foundation of robotics.

A certificate will be provided upon completion of the assignments and the final capstone project.  

While workshops on campus are usually used to generate revenue for the club, given the tiring times and the online semester we have decided to go for a 0 profit event to make the workshop accessible to as many people as possible.

Given the hands-on nature of the workshop participants are encouraged to procure the kit around which the workshop has been designed. Participants who have prior experience in robotics and have basic electronic components need not purchase the kit and can still attend the workshop.

## What you'll learn
- Basic Arduino concepts
- Sensors - IR, LDR, Ultrasonic
- Integration with Arduino Uno
- Basic C Programming for Arduino
- Electronic Components and thierWorking
- Basic CAD modelling using OnShape

The above will comprise the basic knowledge and skills required to build the following projects:

1. Line follower
2. Obstacle Avoider
3. Light Seeker
4. Radar and many more

`Capstone Project`{:.info}

## Workshop Requirements
You will need the following:
- Laptop with Arduino IDE installed
- Line Follower Workshop Kit (Components listed below)
- Basic C programming knowledge is helpful but not mandatory. (CS F111: Computer Programming at BITS will suffice)

If you have not completed the course or are looking to brush up some concepts, worry not! We will be providing resources for the same as soon as you register.
