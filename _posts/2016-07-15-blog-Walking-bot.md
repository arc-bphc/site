## Materials Used
Parts from mechanix kit were used so that it could all fit together well.

## Working
There is a constant phase difference between the bot which is always maintained.This phase ensures that while one half of the legs are moving
backwards it doesn’t touch the ground and is lifted in the air while the other set of legs push the bot forward.
