## Details
The challenge was to build a robot for the IIT Bombay Techfest which is capable of lifting a ball and shooting it to a particular area. The work started a few weeks ago and the mechanical structure was done as you can see in the video here. The Bot was controlled wirelessly using a glove with an accelerometer and Arduino coupled with RF Transmitter.

The bot received those commands and executed various steps accordingly.
